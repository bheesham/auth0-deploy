## Overview

This directory contains test metadata that is **mocked** and consists entirely of **fake data**. It is intended exclusively for testing purposes and should **not** be used in any real environment.

## Important Notes

- All files and data in this directory are **simulated** and designed to mimic the format and structure expected in testing scenarios.
- The metadata does **not** correspond to any actual data in real systems, applications, or environments.
- This data should only be used for **development, testing, and debugging** within controlled environments.

## Usage

The files and data in this directory are used to mock various scenarios for unit tests, integration tests, and other test suites. It provides a consistent, non-sensitive set of data for developers to use without the risk of exposing real information.

## Disclaimer

**Under no circumstances** should this metadata be utilized in production systems or real environments, as it may not reflect accurate or valid configurations, data schemas, or information.
